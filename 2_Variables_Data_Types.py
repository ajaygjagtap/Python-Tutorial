''' Variables - Variable is like a container that holds the data.
Data Types - Data types specifies the type of value a variable holds.
In pyhton we can print type of any operator using type function'''

# python Built in Data types 
'''1 - Numeric Data = int, float, complex'''
# int : 1, 0, -2
# float : 7.349, -3.479
# complex : 6+3i


# Integer
a = 1 
print("The type of a is ", type(a))

# Float
d = 9.9
print("The type of d is ", type(d))

# Complex
comp = complex(6, 3)
print(comp, "The type of comp is", type(comp))

'''2 - Text Data '''
# str - "Hello World"

# String
c = "Hello World"
print("The type of c is ", type(c))


'''3 - Boolean Data '''
# Boolean data consist of values True or False

# Boolean
b = True  
print("The type of b is ", type(b))


'''4 - Sequenced Data '''
# List -  A list is an ordered collection of data with elements seperated by a comma(,) and enclosed within square[] brackets.
#         List are "Mutable" and can be modified after creation (List is Changable).


# Tuple - A Tuple is an ordered collection of data with elements seperated by a comma(,) and enclosed within round() brackets.
#         Tuple are "Immutable" and cannot be modified after creation (Tuple is Unchangable).


list1 = [1, 2.3, [-4, 5], ["Apple", "Banana"]]
print(list1)



tuple1 = (("Eagle","Parrot"), ("Apple", "Banana"))
print(tuple1)




'''5 - Mapped Data '''
# Dictionary - A dictionary is an unordered collection of data containing a key:value pair.
#              The key:value pair enclosed with curly{} brackets.


dict1 = {"name":"Ajay", "age":20, "canVote":True}
